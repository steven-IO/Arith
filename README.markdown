#Arith

An implementation of the arith language of booleans and arithmetic as described in Benjamin C. Pierce's *Types and Programming Languages*. Instead of being implemented in ocaml though, it is implemented in Haskell, using the Parsec parser combinator library. A good portion of the implementation given in the textbook can and was translated directly from ocaml to haskell.

There's some problems with my implementation, but it was just for practice.
